<p><strong>Expectations for members of the University of Arizona community</strong></p>

<p>We refer you to the [Code of Academic Integrity][ua_coc_site] set forth by the University of Arizona regarding academic honesty as a general set of principles that we seek to uphold in MCB585</p>

<p><strong>Expectations for student behavior</strong></p>

<p>We refer you to the policy regarding [Threatening Behavior by Students][http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students] set forth by the University of Arizona as a strict expectation for MCB585. In addition, the use of cell phones and computers for activities outside of coursework are prohibited during class meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Expectations specific to MCB585</strong></p>

<p>Students are encouraged to work together on the critical thinking exercises, but out-of-class assignments must be completed by each student individually (students may advise their partner on the final presentation).</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-and-accomodations">Accessibility and accomodations</h3>
