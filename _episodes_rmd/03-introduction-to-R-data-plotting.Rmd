### Reading data from a tabulated file (.csv, .txt)

In the majority of cases, your data will be stored in some type of external file. The most common way that scientists store data is in Excel spreadsheets. While there are R packages designed to access data from Excel spreadsheets (e.g., gdata, RODBC, XLConnect, xlsx, RExcel), these packages are often difficult and non-intuitive to use. When you start dealing with larger datasets, accessing data from Excel files in R also gets slow. users often find it easier to save their spreadsheets in one or more [comma-separated values]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#comma-separated-values-csv) (CSV or .csv) or text (TXT or .txt) files and then use R's built in functionality to read and manipulate the data. Both file types are more primitive forms of table/spreadsheet in which data is stored as text with distinct data elements separated by a *delimiting character* (a comma `,` for .csv files and usually a tab `\t` for .txt files).

Thankfully, Excel is capable of opening, editing, and saving both .csv and .txt files, so we can go back and forth between R and Excel when we find it convenient. 

In this short lesson, we'll learn how to read external data from a .csv or .txt file, and write data modified or generatated in R to a new .csv or .txt file. We will also explore the [arguments]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#argument) that allow you read and write the data correctly for your needs.



&nbsp;
#### Loading external data into a data frame

Let's start by loading some sample data and take a look at the first few rows of the contents using the `head()`:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv')
```

&nbsp;

Open up the same file using a basic text editor (e.g. *Notepad* in Windows; *TextEdit* in MacOS). You should see something like this:

> "ID","Gender","Group","BloodPressure","Age","Aneurisms_q1","Aneurisms_q2","Aneurisms_q3","Aneurisms_q4" 
> "Sub001","m","Control",132,16,114,140,202,237
> "Sub002","m","Treatment2",139,17.2,148,209,248,248
> "Sub003","m","Treatment2",130,19.5,196,251,122,177
> "Sub004","f","Treatment1",105,15.7,199,140,233,220
> "Sub005","m","Treatment1",125,19.9,188,120,222,228
> "Sub006","M","Treatment2",112,14.3,260,266,320,294
{: .callout}

&nbsp;

A couple of things to notice:
* The frist line contains column headers.
* The `,` delimiters tell the `read.csv(...)` function where the breaks in the data are located; that is, which data to put in which column of the output data frame.
* Each new line is also a delimiter that tells `read.csv(...)` which data to put in which row in the output data frame
* In this case, all strings are contained withing quotation marks `""`. This is an optional way to tell the program where character strings start and stop. 

On the topic of using quotation marks, open `sample-noquotes.csv` in your text editor to see the quote-free option:

> ID,Gender,Group,BloodPressure,Age,Aneurisms_q1,Aneurisms_q2,Aneurisms_q3,Aneurisms_q4 
> Sub001,m,Control,132,16,114,140,202,237
> Sub002,m,Treatment2,139,17.2,148,209,248,248
> Sub003,m,Treatment2,130,19.5,196,251,122,177
> Sub004,f,Treatment1,105,15.7,199,140,233,220
> Sub005,m,Treatment1,125,19.9,188,120,222,228
> Sub006,M,Treatment2,112,14.3,260,266,320,294
{: .callout}

&nbsp;

And note that the default `read.csv(...)` treats this file identically:

```{r}
dat2 <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample-noquotes.csv')
head(dat2)
```

&nbsp;

Whether to use quotes in your data files is up to you. The default behavior of `read.csv(...)` is smart enough to figure this out on it's own. However, the `read.csv(...)` has an argument called `quote` that dictates how to interpret quotation marks. 

> ## Mis-loading quoted data
>
> What if we force `read.csv("")` to ignore the quotes when they are present?
> Before you run any code, think about what will happen to the data in quotes

>

> dat3 <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv', quote="")
> head(dat3)

> > The quotes are now included as part of the character arguments. It also messed up the header formating, apending
> > an "X" to the beginning and surrounding text with "."ss.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

&nbsp;

What happens if we don't assign the output of `read.csv(...)` to a variable?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv')
```

&nbsp;

As with any other function call, if the output is not explicitly assigned, it will be dumped into the console window.

&nbsp;
#### Changing Delimiters

The default delimiter of the `read.csv()` function is a comma `,`, but you can
use esentially any set of characters as a delimiter. `read.csv(...)` is actually a special case of a broader function called `read.table(...)`, with the delimiter argument (which is `sep`, for "separator") set to `c` by default. Check out the help file for these functions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?read.table # note that `?read.csv` brings up the same help document.
```

&nbsp;

Under the **Usage** section there are multiple functions listed, including `read.table(...)` and `read.csv(...)`. In the parentheses for each function there is a list of arguments. Since `read.table(...)` is the parent function, all arguments are listed. Only arguments with different default values (as indicated by the `=`) are listed for `read.csv(...)`. A default value is the value that each arguement assumes when you do not explicitly enter a value. For example, `read.table(...)` assumes that a data file has no header (`header = FALSE`) and no delimiting character (`sep = ""`) while `read.csv(...)` assumes that a data file does have a header (`header = TRUE`) and a comma as the delimiting character (`sep = ","`), unless you specify otherwise. 

If your data is stored in a tab-delimited text file, you will need to use `read.table(...)` a different delimiting character, or another of the associated functions called `read.delim(...)` which has defaults to a tab-delimited file format. Note that to define a *tab* as a delimiting character, you have to use `\t`.

Let's give it a try using a copy of the `sample.csv` data saved as a tab-delimited `sample.txt` file.

*Note:* From the help file, `read.delim(...)` defaults to `header = TRUE` while we have to explicity definit it when using `read.table(...)`. We will talk about what this means in the next section.

```{r}
# note that read
dat4 <- read.delim(file = 'data/sample.txt')
dat5 <- read.table(file = 'data/sample.txt', header = TRUE)
head(dat4)
head(dat5)
```

&nbsp;

Now let's take a closer look at a couple of useful arguments in `read.table(...)` family of functions.

&nbsp;
#### The `header` Argument

The default for `read.csv(...)` and `read.delim(...)` is to set the `header` argument to `TRUE`. This means that the first row of values in the .csv or .txt is used to define the column names for the data frame. If your data set does not have a header, set the `header` argument to `FALSE`. 

> ## Mis-loading data with headers
>
> What happens if you forget to put `header = FALSE`? The default value is
> `header = TRUE`, which you can check with `?read.csv` or `help(read.csv)`.
> What do you expect will happen if you leave the default value?
> Before you run any code, think about what will happen to the first few rows
> of your data frame, and its overall size. Then run the following code and
> see if your expectations agree:
>
> ```{r, eval = FALSE}
> dat6 <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv', header = FALSE)
> head(dat6)
> ```
>
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > The `read.csv(...)` function sets the column names as the default values (`V1, V2, V3, ...`) and 
> > treats the first row of the `sample.csv` file as the first row of data. Clearly this is not the 
> > desired behavior for this data set, but it will be useful if you have a dataset without headers.
> > Note that the `V` is prepended just a number would not be a valid variable name. 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

&nbsp;
#### The `stringsAsFactors` Argument

This is perhaps the most important argument in `read.csv(...)`, particularly if you are working with categorical data. This is because the default behavior of R is to convert character [string]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#string)s into factors, which may make it difficult to do such things as replace values. 

For example, let's look at the `car-speeds.csv` data set. We find out that the data collector was color blind, and accidentally recorded green cars as being blue. In order to correct the data set, let's replace 'Blue' with 'Green' in the `$Color` column:

```{r}
# First - load the data and take a look at what information is available
carSpeeds <- read.csv(file = 'data/car-speeds.csv')
head(carSpeeds)

# Next use indexing to replace all `Blue` entries in the Color column with 'Green'
carSpeeds$Color[carSpeeds$Color == 'Blue'] = 'Green'
```

&nbsp;

What happened? The colors of the cars were loaded as factors by `read.csv(...)` by default. Since `Green` was not in the original set of colors, it was not included as a level in the factor. 

To see the internal structure, we can use another function, `str()`. In this case,
the dataframe's internal structure includes the format of each column, which is what
we are interested in. `str()` will be reviewed a little more in the lesson
[Data Types and Structures]({{ page.root }}/13-supp-data-structures/).

```{r}
str(carSpeeds)
```

&nbsp;

We can see that the `$Color` and `$State` columns are factors and `$Speed` is a numeric column. 

One way to solve this problem would be to add the `Green` level to the `Color` factor, but there is a simpler way. Let's reload the dataset using `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`, and see what happens when we try to replace 'Blue' with 'Green' in the `$Color` column:

```{r}
# First - load the data and take a look at what information is available
carSpeeds <- read.csv(file = 'data/car-speeds.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(carSpeeds)

# Next use indexing to replace all `Blue` entries in the Color column with 'Green'
carSpeeds$Color[carSpeeds$Color == 'Blue'] = 'Green'
carSpeeds$Color
```

&nbsp;

That's better! And we can see how the data now is read as character instead of factor.

***
### Writing tabular data to a file (.csv, .txt)

After altering our cars dataset by replacing 'Blue' with 'Green' in the `$Color` column, we now want to save the output. The `read.table(...)` function family has a corresponding set of `write.table(...)` functions. These functions have a familiar set of arguments:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?read.table
```

&nbsp;

Here is the basic format for writing a table:

```{r}
# Export the data. The write.csv() function requires a minimum of two
# arguments, the data to be saved and the name of the output file.

write.csv(carSpeeds, file = 'data/car-speeds-cleaned.csv')
```

If you open the file, you'll see that it has header names, because the data had headers within R, but that there are also numbers in the first column.

```{r, fig.align="left", out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../fig/01-supp-csv-with-row-nums.png")
```

&nbsp;

This extra column can cause problems when trying to open data in some other programs, and in most cases you won't want to explicity name the rows. This can be easily disabled with a simple argument:

&nbsp;
#### The `row.names` Argument

This argument allows us to set the names of the rows in the output data file. R's default for this argument is `TRUE`, and since it does not know what else to name the rows for the cars data set, it resorts to using row numbers. To turn row numbers off, we can set `row.names` to `FALSE`:

```{r}
write.csv(carSpeeds, file = 'data/car-speeds-cleaned.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

Now we see:

```{r, fig.align="left", out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../fig/01-supp-csv-without-row-nums.png")
```

&nbsp;

> ## Setting Column Names
>
> There is also a `col.names` argument, which can be used to set the column
> names for a data set without headers. If the data set already has headers
> (e.g., we used the `headers = TRUE` argument when importing the data) then a
> `col.names` argument will be ignored.
{: .callout}

&nbsp;
#### The `na` Argument

There are times when we want to specify certain values for `NA`s in the data set (e.g., we are going to pass the data to a program that only accepts -9999 as a nodata value). In this case, we want to set the `NA` value of our output file to the desired value, using the na argument. Let's see how this works:

```{r}
# First, replace the speed in the 3rd row with NA, by using an index (square
# brackets to indicate the position of the value we want to replace)
carSpeeds$Speed[3] <- NA
head(carSpeeds)

write.csv(carSpeeds, file = 'data/car-speeds-cleaned.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

&nbsp;

Now we'll set `NA` to -9999 when we write the new .csv file:

```{r}
# Note - the na argument requires a string input
write.csv(carSpeeds,
          file = 'data/car-speeds-cleaned.csv',
          row.names = FALSE,
          na = '-9999')
```

&nbsp;

And we see:

```{r, fig.align="left", out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("../fig/01-supp-csv-with-special-NA.png")
```

&nbsp;

This can be useful when exporting data from R in a different program that either does not recognize `NA` or uses a different symbol for missing data.

***
### Manipulating Data

Now that our data are loaded into R, we can start doing things with them. First, let's ask what type of thing `dat` is:

```{r}
class(dat)
```

&nbsp;

The output tells us that it's a data frame. As noted in the previous lesson, data frames are the *de facto* data type in R, and many functions will produce data frames as output.

We can see the shape, or [dimensions]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#dimensions-of-an-array), of the data frame with the function `dim`:

```{r}
dim(dat)
```

&nbsp;

This tells us that our data frame, `dat`, has `r nrow(dat)` rows and `r ncol(dat)` columns.

Reviewing the basic types of subsetting, if we want to get a single value from the data frame, we can provide an [index]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#index) in square brackets. The first number specifies the row and the second the column:

```{r selecting data frame elements}
# first value in dat, row 1, column 1
dat[1, 1]
# middle value in dat, row 30, column 6
dat[30, 6]
```

&nbsp;

Or we can select sequential or non-sequential subsets using the `:` operator or `c()` function, respectively:

```{r selecting with c}
# output the first 4 rows and first 3 columns of dat
dat[1:4, 1:3]
# output rows 1, 3, and, 5, and columsn 2 and 6
dat[c(1, 3, 5), c(2, 6)]
```

&nbsp;

If you want to select all rows or all columns, leave that index value empty. 

```{r}
# All columns from row 5
dat[5, ]
# All rows from column 6-8
dat[, 6:9]
```

&nbsp;

Or select columns by name:

```{r}
# select the BloodPressure data
dat$BloodPressure
# select all rows for the Gender and BloodPressure columns
dat[, c("Gender", "BloodPressure")]
```


If you leave both index values empty (i.e., `dat[,]`), you get the entire data frame. 

***
### Calculating basic statistics

Now let's perform some common mathematical operations to learn more about our data. Before we begin, let's clean up our environment and reload our sample data to reset any unintended changes and be sure that we include `header=TRUE` and `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
dat <- read.csv(file="data/sample.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

&nbsp;

This data is the results of an (not real) experiment, looking at the number of aneurisms that formed in the eyes of patients who undertook 3 different treatments.

When analyzing data we often want to look at partial statistics, such as the maximum value per patient or the average value per treatment group. One way to do this is to select the data we want to create a new temporary data frame, and then perform the calculation on this subset:

```{r}
# select aneurism data for the first subject
sub1 <- dat[1, 6:9]

# max number of aneurisms for subject 1
max(sub1)
```

&nbsp;

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

```{r}
# max inflammation for subject 2
max(dat[2, 6:9])
```

&nbsp;

R also has functions for other common calculations, e.g. finding the minimum, mean, median, and standard deviation of the data:

```{r}
# minimum number of aneurisms in q3
min(dat$Aneurisms_q3)

# mean number of aneurisms in q3
mean(dat$Aneurisms_q3)

# median number of aneurisms in q3
median(dat$Aneurisms_q3)

# standard deviation number of aneurisms in q3
sd(dat$Aneurisms_q3)

# total number of observations in q3
length(dat$Aneurisms_q3)
```

&nbsp;

R has a function called `summary()` that provides a convenient summary of each column:

```{r}
# Summarize function
summary(dat)
```

&nbsp; 

For every column in the data frame, `summary()` provides a different of summary data depending on the class of that column. For instance, for `numeric` columns, `summary()` provides minimun, maximum, mean, median, and quartile values. 

What if we need the maximum number of aneurisms across quarters for each patient, or perhaps the average across quarters? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the operation across a `margin` of the data frame; that is we want to perform the same function (`mean()`) on the last 4 columns for every row:

<img src="../fig/r-operations-across-margins.svg" alt="Operations Across Margins" />

To support this, we can use the `apply` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?apply
```

&nbsp;

`apply` allows us to repeat a function on all of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) or columns (`MARGIN = 2`) of a data frame. Thus, to obtain the average inflammation of each patient we will need to calculate the mean of all of the rows (`MARGIN = 1`) of the data frame.

```{r}
avg_aneurisms_subject <- apply(dat[,6:9], 1, mean)
```

&nbsp;

And to obtain the average number of aneurisms for each quater, mean of all of the columns (`MARGIN = 2`) of the data frame:

```{r}
avg_aneurisms_quarter <- apply(dat[,6:9], 2, mean)
```

&nbsp; 

> ## Argument Order in Functions
> 
> Notice that we did not specify the argument names in `apply()`. Looking at the help file, the argument 
> order is `X` (indicating the input data), then `MARGIN`, then `FUN` (for function to apply). So long as you 
> enter arguments in the requested order, you do not need to be explicity about which argument you are 
> referring too. `apply()` just assums that the first argument entered is the value for `X`, the second is the > value for `MARGIN`, and the third is the value for `FUN`. You can mix up the order, but then you have to be 
> explicit about which argument you are defining.
>
> For example, this will return an error:
> ```{r eval=F}
> avg_aneurisms_subject <- apply(mean, 1, dat[,6:9])
> ```
> 
> while this will be interpreted identically to the earlier function call:
> ```{r eval=F}
> avg_aneurisms_subject <- apply(FUN = mean, MARGIN = 1, X = dat[,6:9])
> ```

In this data frame, patient data is organised in rows and the days are represented by the columns. Subscripting in R follows the `[i, j]` principle, where `i = rows` and `j = columns`. Thus, answer 3 is correct since the patient is represented by the value for i (5) and the days are represented by the values in j, which is a subset spanning day 9 to 7.

### Plotting

The mathematician Richard Hamming once said, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers."*

The best way to develop insight is often to visualize data. Visualization deserves an entire lecture (or course) of its own, but we can explore a few of R's plotting features.

Let's take a look at the average number of aneurisms over time. Recall that we already calculated these values above using `apply(dat[,6:9], 2, mean)` and saved them in the variable `avg_aneurisms_quarter`.
Plotting the values is done with the function `plot()`.

```{r}
plot(avg_aneurisms_quarter)
```

Above, we gave the function `plot()` a vector of numbers corresponding to the average inflammation per day across all patients.
`plot` created a scatter plot where the y-axis is the average inflammation level and the x-axis is the order, or index, of the values in the vector, which in this case correspond to the 40 days of treatment.
The result is roughly a linear rise and fall, which is suspicious: based on other studies, we expect a sharper rise and slower fall.
Let's have a look at two other statistics: the maximum and minimum inflammation per day.

```{r}
max_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, max)
plot(max_day_inflammation)
```

```{r}
min_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, min)
plot(min_day_inflammation)
```

The maximum value rises and falls perfectly smoothly, while the minimum seems to be a step function. Neither result seems particularly likely, so either there's a mistake in our calculations or something is wrong with our data.

### Saving Plots to a File

So far, we have built a function `analyze` to plot summary statistics of the inflammation data:

```{r}
analyze <- function(filename) {
  # Plots the average, min, and max inflammation over time.
  # Input is character string of a csv file.
  dat <- read.csv(file = filename, header = FALSE)
  avg_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, mean)
  plot(avg_day_inflammation)
  max_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, max)
  plot(max_day_inflammation)
  min_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, min)
  plot(min_day_inflammation)
}
```

And also built the function `analyze_all` to automate the processing of each data file:

```{r}
analyze_all <- function(folder = "data", pattern) {
  # Runs the function analyze for each file in the given folder
  # that contains the given pattern.
  filenames <- list.files(path = folder, pattern = pattern, full.names = TRUE)
  for (f in filenames) {
    analyze(f)
  }
}
```

While these are useful in an interactive R session, what if we want to send our results to our collaborators?
Since we currently have 12 data sets, running `analyze_all` creates 36 plots.
Saving each of these individually would be tedious and error-prone.
And in the likely situation that we want to change how the data is processed or the look of the plots, we would have to once again save all 36 before sharing the updated results with our collaborators.

Here's how we can save all three plots of the first inflammation data set in a pdf file:

```{r, results='hide'}
pdf("inflammation-01.pdf")
analyze("data/inflammation-01.csv")
dev.off()
```

The function `pdf` redirects all the plots generated by R into a pdf file, which in this case we have named "inflammation-01.pdf".
After we are done generating the plots to be saved in the pdf file, we stop R from redirecting plots with the function `dev.off`.

> ## Overwriting Plots
>
> If you run `pdf` multiple times without running `dev.off`, you will save plots to the most recently opened file.
> However, you won't be able to open the previous pdf files because the connections were not closed.
> In order to get out of this situation, you'll need to run `dev.off` until all the pdf connections are closed.
> You can check your current status using the function `dev.cur`.
> If it says "pdf", all your plots are being saved in the last pdf specified.
> If it says "null device" or "RStudioGD", the plots will be visualized normally.
{: .callout}

We can update the `analyze` function so that it always saves the plots in a pdf.
But that would make it more difficult to interactively test out new changes.
It would be ideal if `analyze` would either save or not save the plots based on its input.

### Saving Automatically Generated Figures

Now that we know how to have R make decisions based on input values,
let's update `analyze`:

```{r}
analyze <- function(filename, output = NULL) {
  # Plots the average, min, and max inflammation over time.
  # Input:
  #    filename: character string of a csv file
  #    output: character string of pdf file for saving
  if (!is.null(output)) {
    pdf(output)
  }
  dat <- read.csv(file = filename, header = FALSE)
  avg_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, mean)
  plot(avg_day_inflammation)
  max_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, max)
  plot(max_day_inflammation)
  min_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, min)
  plot(min_day_inflammation)
  if (!is.null(output)) {
    dev.off()
  }
}
```

We added an argument, `output`, that by default is set to `NULL`.
An `if` statement at the beginning checks the argument `output` to decide whether or not to save the plots to a pdf.
Let's break it down.
The function `is.null` returns `TRUE` if a variable is `NULL` and `FALSE` otherwise.
The exclamation mark, `!`, stands for "not".
Therefore the line in the `if` block is only executed if `output` is "not null".

```{r}
output <- NULL
is.null(output)
!is.null(output)
```

Now we can use `analyze` interactively, as before,

```{r}
analyze("data/inflammation-01.csv")
```

but also use it to save plots,

```{r}
analyze("data/inflammation-01.csv", output = "inflammation-01.pdf")
```

Before going further, we will create a directory `results` for saving our plots.
It is [good practice](http://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/) in data analysis projects to save all output to a directory separate from the data and analysis code.
You can create this directory using the shell command [mkdir]({{ site.swc_pages }}/shell-novice/03-create/), or the R function `dir.create()`
```{r}
dir.create("results")
```

Now run `analyze` and save the plot in the `results` directory,
```{r}
analyze("data/inflammation-01.csv", output = "results/inflammation-01.pdf")
```

This now works well when we want to process one data file at a time, but how can we specify the output file in `analyze_all`?
We need to do two things:

1. Substitute the filename ending "csv" with "pdf".
2. Save the plot to the `results` directory.

To change the extension to "pdf", we will use the function `sub`,
```{r}
f <- "inflammation-01.csv"
sub("csv", "pdf", f)
```
To add the "results" directory to the filename use the function `file.path`,
```{r}
file.path("results", sub("csv", "pdf", f))
```


Now let's update `analyze_all`:

```{r}
analyze_all <- function(pattern) {
  # Directory name containing the data
  data_dir <- "data"
  # Directory name for results
  results_dir <- "results"
  # Runs the function analyze for each file in the current working directory
  # that contains the given pattern.
  filenames <- list.files(path = data_dir, pattern = pattern)
  for (f in filenames) {
    pdf_name <- file.path(results_dir, sub("csv", "pdf", f))
    analyze(file.path(data_dir, f), output = pdf_name)
  }
}
```

Now we can save all of the results with just one line of code:

```{r}
analyze_all("inflammation.*csv")
```

Now if we need to make any changes to our analysis, we can edit the `analyze` function and quickly regenerate all the figures with `analyze_all`.

#### Using Factors

Lets load our example data to see the use of factors:

```{r}
dat <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv', stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

> ## Default Behavior
>
> `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` is the default behavior for R.
> We could leave this argument out.
> It is included here for clarity.
{: .callout}

```{r}
str(dat)
```

Notice the first 3 columns have been converted to factors. These values were text in the data file so R automatically interpreted them as categorical variables.

```{r}
summary(dat)
```

Notice the `summary()` function handles factors differently to numbers (and strings), the occurrence counts for each value is often more useful information.

> ## The `summary()` Function
>
> The `summary()` function is a great way of spotting errors in your data (look at the *dat$Gender* column).
> It's also a great way for spotting missing data.

#### Removing Levels from a Factor

Some of the Gender values in our dataset have been coded incorrectly.
Let's remove levels from this factor.

```{r}
barplot(table(dat$Gender))
```

Values should have been recorded as lowercase 'm' and 'f'. We should correct this.

```{r}
dat$Gender[dat$Gender == 'M'] <- 'm'
```

> ## Updating Factors
>
> ```{r updating-factors}
> plot(x = dat$Gender, y = dat$BloodPressure)
> ```
>
> Why does this plot show 4 levels?
>
> *Hint* how many levels does dat$Gender have?
> > ## Solution
> > `dat$Gender` has 4 levels, so the plot shows 4 levels.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We need to tell R that "M" is no longer a valid value for this column.
We use the `droplevels()` function to remove extra levels.

```{r}
dat$Gender <- droplevels(dat$Gender)
plot(x = dat$Gender, y = dat$BloodPressure)
```

> ## Adjusting Factor Levels
>
> Adjusting the `levels()` of a factor provides a useful shortcut for reassigning values in this case.
>
> ```{r adjusting-levels}
> levels(dat$Gender)[2] <- 'f'
> plot(x = dat$Gender, y = dat$BloodPressure)
> ```
