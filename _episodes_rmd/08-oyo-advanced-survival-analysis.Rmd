title: "Advanced Survival Analysis"
classdate: "9/18/2020 -- On Your Own"
teaching: 90
exercises: 30
questions:
- "What statistical models are used to describe survival data?"
- "What is the proportional hazards assumption?"
- "How can Cox Proportional Hazard regession be employed for advanced survival analysis?"
objectives:
- "Describe the basic assumptions underlying common models for survival data."
- "Use Cox Proportional Hazard regression to analyze more complex survival datasets, such as the relationship between more than one independent variable."
keypoints:
- "There are multiple commonly used modesl for describing time-to-event data, including exponential decay, accelerated failure time, and propotional hazards."
- "Each model makes specific assumptions and tend to be employed for specific types of time-to-event data."
- "The most common form of advanced analysis is Cox Proportional Hazards, which assumes that the ratio between the hazard functions for two populations remains constant over time."
