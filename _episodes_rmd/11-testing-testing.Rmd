Principles of world domination:
* Just *don't*
* Too much `pwr`

### Simulating power

That was actually a real title in the class. Very different context.

1. Do this:
 + Don't do that.
 + Just this.
2. Stop. $$\alpha$$ $$\beta$$


```{r}
# load libraries
library("survival")

# Just because
print("Hello World!")
```

This line intentionally left blank. **doh**
