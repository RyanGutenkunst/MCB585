title: "Decision Making and Loops -- Additional Detail"
classdate: "9/9/2020 -- On Your Own"
teaching: 90
exercises: 30
questions:
- "What is vectorization?"
- "Are there different indexing strategies for different situations using a `for` loop?"
- "Should I use a loop or an `apply` statement?"
objectives:
- "Understand how R interprets simple operations (e.g. addition) when applied to data vectors."
- "Use either the elements or the position in a vector as the primary index in a `for` loop."
- "Compare loops and vectorized operations."
- "Trace changes to a loop variable as the loop runs."
- "Trace changes to other variables as they are updated by a `for` loop."
- "Use a function to get a list of filenames that match a simple pattern."
- "Understand the advanatages and disadvantages to using apply functions vs. for loops."
keypoints:
- "In most cases, R applies simple operations on vectors as meant to each element of the vector(s)."
- "If a simple operation is requested on vectors of different lengths, R will either return and error or repeatedly loop through the elements of the shorter vector, depending on the operation."
- "Where possible, use vectorized operations instead of `for` loops to make code faster and more concise."
- "Use `length(thing)` to determine the length of something that contains other values."
- "Use functions such as `apply` instead of `for` loops to operate on the values in a data structure."
- "Use `list.files(path = \"path\", pattern = \"pattern\", full.names = TRUE)` to create a list of files whose names match a pattern."
