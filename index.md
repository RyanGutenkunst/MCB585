Welcome to MCB 585! This course is offered by the Molecular & Cellular Biology Department at the University of Arizona. 

MCB585 is an advanced graduate course focused on quantitative approaches to biological questions. Students will learn how to acquire, access, and interact with large biological datasets. The course relies heavily on learning and utilizing the R Statistical Programing language, but students are not expected to have programing experience upon entering the course. The course is broken up into two parts. The first part will focus on introducing R, using R in basic statistical operations, and approaching and manipulating large datasets. This section incorporates elements of experimental design and appropriate application of statistical tests as a frame for learning R. The second section focuses on extracting quantitative information from image data and applying the statistical tools from the first section on this data.

**Instructors:**

*   **George Sutphin**, Assistant Professor, Molecule & Cellular Biology
*   **Andrew Paek**, Assistant Professor, Molecule & Cellular Biology


**Course Goals:**

Students will be able to:
1.	Use the R programing environment to approach basic problems biological sciences.
2.	Apply basic biostatistics methods, such as selecting and employing an appropriate statistical test and conducting a power analysis based on preliminary data.
3.	Access, manipulate, and analyze large biological datasets.
4.	Segment and extract quantitative information from imaging data.

**Course Requirements:**
1.  Attendance in class sessions.
2.  Participation in discussions and in-class exercises.
3.  Reading assignments, completed before class.
4.  Computer exercises before and during class.
