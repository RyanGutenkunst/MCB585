title: "Distributions and Normality -- Additional Detail"
classdate: "9/11/2020 -- On Your Own"
teaching: 90
exercises: 30
questions:
- "Is there a statistical method for assessing normality?"
- "What options do I have if my data is not normally ditributed?"
objectives:
- "Be able to conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test in R, but also understand the limitations of this test."
- "Carry out simple reversible data transformations to normalize data."
- "Know where to go for more advanced data transformations."
keypoints:
- "Use shapiro.test() to perform at Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. However, the power of the test is such that a negative result can eitehr indicate insufficient sample size or lack of normality."
- "Simple manipulations such as taking the logrithm or the square root of a sample can reversibly transform the observations into a more normal distribution."
